## Hello World (AKA the 2 or 3 people that have opened my GitHub)

Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ˜Ž!
Here, youâ€™ll find a variety of fun projects â€” from VR/AR applications (personal, research, and club) to hackathons, full-stack study abroad projects, and class projects I've worked on since high school. 

Iâ€™d love to chat!
Email: li.bra@northeastern.edu (cool email, right? *libra*)
