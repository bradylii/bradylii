## Hello :D

Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ˜Ž!
Here, youâ€™ll find a variety of fun projects â€” from VR/AR applications (personal, research, and club) to hackathons, full-stack study abroad projects, and class projects I've worked on since high school. FYI many research and work projects I've spent time on are not public!  

Can you tell I like (`parentheses`)? If we work together, you might see this in the Jira and PR comments I do; I like documenting my work.

A more digestible display of my projects and experiences on my [portfolio site](https://bradyli.dev/)!

Iâ€™d love to chat!
